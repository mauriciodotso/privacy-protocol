# privacy-protocol
In this paper, we propose a new way of interaction among users, service providers and identity providers to perform authentication of users in order to disturb as little as possible users, and at the same time, allow greater control of the user privacy data. We have listed a number of user rights as a way of justify the new model. We analyzed the new model from the aspects of security and implementation.
